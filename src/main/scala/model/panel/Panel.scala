/** Represents a single cell on a board, known as a Panel.
 *
 * Each panel has its own effect, which can be applied to a character.
 * In the context of the board game, a panel represents a tile or space that a character lands on
 * and experiences an effect (e.g., losing stars, fighting an enemy, etc.).
 * Panels can also be connected to other panels, allowing for the formation of complex board
 * structures.
