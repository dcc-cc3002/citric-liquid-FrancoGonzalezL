/** Represent The Game.
 *
 *  Each game match is divided into chapters, which are further divided into
 *  4 turns, one for each player.
 *
 *  At the beginning of the match, the turn order is randomly assigned to the
 *  players and remains the same throughout the entire match.
 *
 *  Whenever all 4 players finish their respective turns, the
 *  game proceeds to the next chapter, which in this case serves as a mere counter.
 *
 *  Each player's turn is structured as follows:
 *   - If they are in a K.O. state, they move to the Recovery phase.
 *   - Receive stars.
 *   - Roll a die and move the number of panels indicated by the result, except in cases where they can stop prematurely.
 *   - The panel's effect is activated.
 *   - Proceed to the next player's turn.
